This Python code utilizes Biopython's Phylo module to extract clade names from a phylogenetic tree stored in a Nexus file format.

```python
from Bio import Phylo

def extract_clade_names(tree_file, branch_length_threshold, example_names):
    tree = Phylo.read(tree_file, 'nexus')

    # Find the common ancestor of the example names
    common_ancestor = tree.common_ancestor(example_names)

    # Extract the clade under the common ancestor with branch lengths below the threshold
    clade_names = set()
    for clade in common_ancestor.get_terminals():
        if clade.branch_length is not None:
            branch_length = float(clade.branch_length)
            if branch_length <= branch_length_threshold:
                clade_names.add(clade.name)

    return clade_names

# Example usage
tree_file = '/home/genivaldo/tree.nex'  # Replace with the path to your Nexus file
threshold = input("Bootstrap threshold: (e.g. 0.99) ")
branch_support_threshold = float(threshold)
sp1 = input("Species 1: ")
sp2 = input("Species 2: ")
example_names = [sp1, sp2]
clade_names = extract_clade_names(tree_file, branch_support_threshold, example_names)

print(clade_names)


```markdown
1. The function `extract_clade_names` takes three arguments:
   - `tree_file`: the path to the Nexus file containing the phylogenetic tree.
   - `branch_length_threshold`: a threshold value for branch lengths, below which clade names will be extracted.
   - `example_names`: a list of names representing species for which the common ancestor and its clades will be extracted.

2. The function reads the phylogenetic tree from the Nexus file using `Phylo.read()`.

3. It finds the common ancestor of the species provided in `example_names` using `tree.common_ancestor()`.

4. It then iterates over each terminal node (clade) under the common ancestor using `common_ancestor.get_terminals()`.

5. For each clade, it checks if the branch length is below or equal to the specified threshold. If it is, the clade name is added to a set `clade_names`.

6. Finally, it returns the set of clade names that meet the branch length criterion.

7. The script prompts the user to input the bootstrap threshold (as a float value) and the names of two species.

8. It calls the `extract_clade_names` function with the provided inputs and prints the resulting set of clade names.
